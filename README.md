# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
So this project is the first step towards building a first full web application (which is an AirBnB clone). This first step consists of a custom command-line interface for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data.

## Step 1: Write a command interpreter (The Console)

### Functionalities of this command interpreter:
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## Console and Command Usage
The console is a Unix shell-like command line user interface provided by the python CmdModule It prints a prompt and waits for the user for input, for our project we used (hbnb)


- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
  
### Execution
#### Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```

#### But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
  
  


## Models

The folder [models](./models/) contains all the classes used in this project.

- a unique id generated using ```uuid``` package
- the attribute ```created_at```, a ```datetime``` object, indicating when the object is created
- the attribute ```updated_at```, a ```datetime``` object, indicating when the object is last updated
- the attribute ```__class__```, a ```str``` object, indicating what is the object's type (model)

File | Description | Attributes
---- | ----------- | ----------
[base_model.py](./models/base_model.py) | BaseModel class for all the other classes | id, created_at, updated_at
[user.py](./models/user.py) | User class for future user information | email, password, first_name, last_name
[amenity.py](./models/amenity.py) | Amenity class for future amenity information | name
[city.py](./models/city.py) | City class for future location information | state_id, name
[state.py](./models/state.py) | State class for future location information | name
[place.py](./models/place.py) | Place class for future accomodation information | city_id, user_id, name, description, number_rooms, number_bathrooms, max_guest, price_by_night, latitude, longitude, amenity_ids
[review.py](./models/review.py) | Review class for future user/host review information | place_id, user_id, text

## File storage

The folder [engine](./models/engine/) manages the serialization and deserialization of all the data, following a JSON format.

A FileStorage class is defined in [file_storage.py](./models/engine/file_storage.py) with methods to follow this flow:
```<object> -> to_dict() -> <dictionary> -> JSON dump -> <json string> -> FILE -> <json string> -> JSON load -> <dictionary> -> <object>```

The [__init__.py](./models/__init__.py) file contains the instantiation of the FileStorage class called **storage**, followed by a call to the method reload() on that instance.
This allows the storage to be reloaded automatically at initialization, which recovers the serialized data.
